      "2A The amount referred to in subsection (2) is—\n",

      "4 A rent repayment order made in accordance with subsection (2) may not require the payment of any amount which the tribunal is satisfied that, by reason of any exceptional circumstances, it would be unreasonable for that person to be required to pay.\n",
      "5 In a case where subsection (2) does not apply, the amount required to be paid by virtue of a rent repayment order under section 96(5) is to be such amount as the tribunal considers reasonable in the circumstances.\n",
      "6 In such a case the tribunal must, in particular, take into account the following matters—\n",

      "a  does not, when recovered by the authority, constitute an amount of universal credit or housing benefit recovered by them, and\n",
      "b  is, until recovered by them, a legal charge on the house which is a local land charge.\n",
      "10 For the purpose of enforcing that charge the authority have the same powers and remedies under the Law of Property Act 1925 (c. 20) and otherwise as if they were mortgagees by deed having powers of sale and lease, and of accepting surrenders of leases and of appointing a receiver.\n",
      "11 The power of appointing a receiver is exercisable at any time after the end of the period of one month beginning with the date on which the charge takes effect.\n",

      "b  to do so in such instalments as are specified in the licence.\n",

      "14 Any amount payable to an occupier by virtue of a rent repayment order is recoverable by the occupier as a debt due to him from the appropriate person.\n",
      "15 The appropriate national authority may by regulations make such provision as it considers appropriate for supplementing the provisions of this section and section 96, and in particular—\n",
      "a  for securing that persons are not unfairly prejudiced by rent repayment orders (whether in cases where there have been over-payments of universal credit or housing benefit or otherwise);\n",
